# Ptolemy-Neural-Network
This repo contains a fully connected neural network implementation and also a GRU and LSTM network implementation in Ptolemy II.

## Documentation
Please read the fully connected neural network [Documentation](old-ptolemy-implementations/Fully-connected%20neural%20network/Documentation%20of%20a%20fully-connected%20neural%20network.pdf) file in order to reproduce our example in Ptolemy II.

Please read the GRU and LSTM network [Documentation](old-ptolemy-implementations/GRU-LSTM/Documentation%20for%20GRU%20and%20LSTM%20network%20implementation%20in%20Ptolemy%20II.pdf) file in order to reproduce our example in Ptolemy II.

# Update!!
New implementation can be found in the **current-ptolemy-implementations** folder.
