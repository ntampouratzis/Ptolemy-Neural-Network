# Ptolemy-Neural-Network
This repo contains a fully connected neural network implementation and also a GRU and LSTM network implementation in Ptolemy II.

# Fully-Connected Network 
A two hidden layer architecture trained for handwritten digit recognition.

It gets as input a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit and it produces the probabilities related to the 10 classes of digits from 0 to 9.
